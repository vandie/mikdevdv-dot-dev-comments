# mikdevdv-dot-dev-comments
~~Didn't want to have to roll my own comment system for the blog on [mikevdv.dev](https://mikevdv.dev/blog) so using [utterance](https://utteranc.es).
This is the repo which holds all the comments~~

My blog over at [mikevdv.dev](https://mikevdv.dev/blog) now uses [Webmentions](https://mikevdv.dev/blog/2022-08-25-switching-to-webmention-comments) to handle comments. While this repo was originally created to make use of [utterance](https://utteranc.es), comments posted here continue to be supported. Despite them now being displayed via a different format.
